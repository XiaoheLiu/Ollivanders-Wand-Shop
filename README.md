# Ollilvanders Wand Shop

A shop landing page for the imaginary wand maker, Ollivander, from the _Harry Potter_ books.

This page showcases my skills to:
- Use CSS3 flexbox to create a dynamic UI;
- Use media query to accomodate different screen sizes;
- Use CSS @keyframes to create animations;
- Use html to create an accessible webpage.

See a demo of the full page at [codepen](https://codepen.io/sd_athena/pen/VEYVZp).

This is one of the five projects that I did for the Responsive Web Design Certificate at freeCodeCamp.org : "[Build a Product Landing Page](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page/)".
